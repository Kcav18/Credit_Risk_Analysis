# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, I used several different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asked me to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Lastly, I will evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk.
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk.
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk.
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
